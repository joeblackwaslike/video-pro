  title: Acid Synth Emulation In Analog
  description: In this Ableton Live synthesis tutorial, Myagi, our resident synthesis expert, shows us how to create an acid synth emulator using Ableton's Analog synth. This full length synthesis tutorial walks you through using subtractive synthesis, Instrument and Audio Effect Racks, and macro mappings to create this convincing emulation. As an added bonus, we provide the synth preset, Instrument Rack, and Audio Effects Rack as a free Ableton Live Pack download.

  title:  Granular  Style Effects In Sampler
  description: In this Ableton Live synthesis tutorial, Myagi shows off how to get under the hood in Sampler and make it do some tricks that are anything but obvious. Looking at repurposing the Aux Envelope, he shows how you can control sample position using a Macro Knob and make Sampler behave akin to a granular synth. The sky is the limit with this one. As an added bonus, we provide the synth preset, Instrument Rack, and Audio Effects Rack as a free Ableton Live Pack download.

  title: Introduction
  description: In this series, we’re going to journey where many fear to tread, the deepest aspects of Drum Racks. In fact, going beyond the basics of Drum Racks is essential to making the complex and exciting drum palettes that make tracks stand out. We’ll explore how the sound of your Drum Rack can quickly and dramatically change through top-level controls, and how to use the sophisticated layering options not found on other drum samplers.  By understanding Macros, Multis, I/O routings and Choke Groups you’ll be able to build versatile percussion kits, and you’ll also be able to rapidly understand or edit whatever Drum Rack you come across. Finally, we’ll look at how to use Drum Racks on non-percussive material like vocals and sustained, growly bass notes. So, are you ready to become a Drum Rack guru?

  title: Introduction
  description: As you know, sampling is an important feature of modern music. Whether you’re making hip hop, house, techno, etc, sampling can be the catalyst for fresh beats or musical textures. Ableton’s unique Slice to New MIDI Track feature provides this capability and more. Starting with a cool chunk of music, we’ll walk through the process of using Live’s Drum Racks to chop up, affect and rearrange audio. As you’ll see, the Slice to New MIDI Track feature opens up a world of creative possibilities. Remember, you don’t have to pay sampling fees (or, um, break copyright laws) to sample audio - you can apply this process to any piece of audio that ignites your interest.
